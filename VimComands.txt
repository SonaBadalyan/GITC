Vim is a free and open-source, screen-based text editor program for Unix.

Open a new or existing file with vim filename.
Type i to switch into insert mode so that you can start editing the file.
Enter or modify the text with your file.
Once you're done, press the escape key Esc to get out of insert mode and back to command mode.
Type : to put yourself at the commmand line (cursor jumps to bottom of screen)
Type wq to save and exit your file. The w means “write” and q means “quit”.
Or type q! for quit without writing.

                    Text editing commands

1. :[line_number] - goes to the line, that is written in the given number line.
2. yy - copy (yank) the current line.
3. dd - delete the current line.
4. :u or :undo - undo changes.
5. :x it is same as :wq
6. Ctrl - Z  - will exit without saving, and will create a hidden swap file. The swap file is necessary for recover losing information. And every time when we open this file, vim will ask to recover or delete this swap file.

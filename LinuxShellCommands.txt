3.  cd (change directory) - command is used to change the current working directory ( i.e., in which the current user is working). 
        Every directory contains a pointer to itself (.) and a pointer to its parent directory (..) We can navigate to the parent directory using the cd .. command. Or we can run the program from the current directory using the ./a.out command.

        diff a.txt b.txt - shows a and b files differences in the terminal.
        diff a.txt b.txt > c.txt - creates c.txt file and writes a and b files differences in this file.
10. grep (global regular expression print) - is a command-line utility for searching plain-text data sets for lines that match a regular expression.
11. | (pipe) - A pipe is a form of redirection (transfer of standard output to some other destination) that is used to send the output of one command/program/process to another command/program/process for further processing.

        Linux file system follows a tree-like hierarchical structure starting at the root. 
        It consists of directories, sub-directories, and data files. This structure follows a standard layout recommended by Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS), which is a standard maintained by the Linux Foundation.
15. sudo su root (superuser do switch user root) -  change user to root user, as root user has all privileges now we have read/write access.
        If we create the file as the root user we can`t change it as a non-root user. We must have root privileges to do that.
